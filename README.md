# Logo_MakerWJ

## Description

In this project we created a logo makerusing JavaScript and Node JS. This application allows a user to customize a logo by selecting a shape, inputing three letters and selecting a color for the characters and the shape. This challenge also asked us to test our code using Jest. Being able to test our code was helpful in understanding how testing works and it also ensured that we created a working code.
